# LiveKit Agents starter for Python

A starter project for building voice AI apps with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

The starter includes:

- A simple [voice AI assistant](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/) to extend and customize.
- A voice pipeline built on [LiveKit Inference](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/inference/), which gives you access to [models](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/) from top labs with no extra configuration:
  - The default LLM is Gemma 4 31B, an open-weight model [hosted by LiveKit](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/llm/livekit/) and tuned for voice AI.
  - The default TTS is [Fish Audio S2.1 Pro](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/tts/fishaudio/), an expressive and cost-effective voice.
  - More than 50 other models are available from OpenAI, Cartesia, Deepgram, and other providers.
  - [Realtime models](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/realtime/) such as OpenAI GPT-Live. Many other models are available through the [plugin ecosystem](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins).
- [Expressive mode](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/tts/expressive/), on by default, so your agent's voice carries emotion and pacing that fit the conversation.
- [Keyterms](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/stt/keyterms/), on by default, so speech recognition gets your names, brands, and jargon right, including names it picks up during the conversation, like a caller's.
- [LiveKit Turn Detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/logic/turns/turn-detector/), which knows when the user has finished speaking, in 14 languages.
- [Adaptive interruption handling](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/logic/turns/adaptive-interruption-handling/), which tells a real interruption from an "uh-huh" or background noise, so your agent doesn't stop talking when it shouldn't.
- [Background voice cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/noise-cancellation/).
- Session transcripts, traces, and recordings from LiveKit [Agent Observability](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/observability/).
- [Simulations](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/simulations/) that test full conversations with your agent, run in CI on every merge to `main`.
- A `Dockerfile` for [deploying to LiveKit Cloud](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/).

The starter works with any [custom web or mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/) or with [telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/).

## Using coding agents

This project works with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).

LiveKit offers both a CLI and an [MCP server](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/developer-tools/docs-mcp/) for browsing and searching its documentation. Search returns short excerpts, so fetch the full page to read the details:

```console
lk docs search "testing my agent"
lk docs get-page /testing/unit-tests
```

The project also includes an [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) file, so your coding agent follows LiveKit's best practices for workflows, handoffs, and testing, and tries its changes with the [agent debugger](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/debugger/).

For more guidance at each stage of the work, from building and debugging to testing and deploying, install LiveKit's [agent skills](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/#agent-skills). The CLI installs them for the coding agents on your machine and adds the Docs MCP server to their config. `lk agent init` offers to do this when it creates your project, or you can run it yourself:

```console
lk skills install
```

Run `lk skills update` to get the latest skills, and commit `skills-lock.json` along with them. See the [coding agents guide](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/) for more details.

## Dev setup

Install the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/), version 2.18.8 or later:

- **macOS:** `brew install livekit-cli`
- **Linux:** `curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash`
- **Windows:** `winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI`

Check your version with `lk --version`. To update an existing install, see [Update the CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/developer-tools/livekit-cli/#updates).

Then create a project from this template. The CLI clones the template and configures your environment:

```console
lk cloud auth
lk agent init my-agent --template agent-starter-python
```

<details>
<summary>Set up the project manually</summary>

Clone the repository and install dependencies into a virtual environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```console
git clone https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python.git
cd agent-starter-python
uv sync
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/), then copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in. To have the CLI write your project's URL and API keys into the file instead, run:

```console
lk cloud auth
lk app env --write --destination .env.local
```

</details>

## Run the agent

The `lk agent console`, `lk agent dev`, and `lk agent debugger` commands run your agent on your own machine. To talk to it in your terminal:

```console
lk agent console
```

To connect it to LiveKit Cloud so a frontend, a phone call, or the [Agent Console](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/agent-console/) can reach it:

```console
lk agent dev
```

To let a coding agent or a script test it one text turn at a time, use the [agent debugger](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/debugger/). Each turn prints the agent's reply along with the tool calls and handoffs behind it:

```console
lk agent debugger start
lk agent debugger say "Hi, what can you do?"
lk agent debugger stop
```

In production, run the agent directly:

```console
uv run src/agent.py start
```

## Run the local interview UI

Start the local UI server:

```console
uv run src/web.py
```

In another terminal, start the agent worker:

```console
lk agent dev --log-level DEBUG
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), paste the job description into the text box, upload a text-based resume PDF under 3.9 MB, then choose **Begin 10-question interview**. The local server extracts the resume text, dispatches the agent with the job description and resume as private session context, and issues the browser's short-lived LiveKit access token; the API secret and document text stay off the browser. If your worker logs show a non-production deployment such as `dev-...`, set `LIVEKIT_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT` to that deployment in `.env.local` before starting the UI server.

## Deploy the interview UI to Vercel

The web files in `public/` deploy as static assets. `api/connection-details.py` runs as a Vercel Python Function, accepts the job description text and resume PDF, privately dispatches the LiveKit agent with their text, and issues a 10-minute participant token. The API secret and document text are not sent to the browser. Its function region is set to Mumbai (`bom1`). The interviewer asks ten questions total, counting follow-ups, then gives a scorecard. If the candidate ends early, the agent announces that the scorecard is ready, then opens the separate results page with a partial scorecard.

### Restrict demo access and control usage

The interview endpoint requires a shared invite code and consumes quota before creating a LiveKit room. Add these Vercel environment variables for Production and Preview:

- `INTERVIEW_ACCESS_CODE`: a long, randomly generated code shared only with approved testers.
- `INTERVIEW_ACCESS_REQUEST_EMAIL`: email address shown in the **Request demo access** link.
- `INTERVIEW_DAILY_LIMIT_PER_CODE`: daily maximum per invite code (default `3`).
- `INTERVIEW_DAILY_LIMIT_GLOBAL`: daily maximum for the whole demo (default `10`).
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`: credentials for an Upstash Redis database, used for atomic daily counters across Vercel function instances.

If the code or quota store is not configured, the endpoint fails closed and does not start an interview. The current implementation uses one shared invite code; issue a new code by changing `INTERVIEW_ACCESS_CODE` and redeploying. For separate tester codes, expirations, or revoking one person without affecting others, add an authentication service and store hashed, per-user invitations. The local UI also uses these settings from `.env.local`.

1. Deploy the agent to LiveKit Cloud first, using the India deployment region:

   ```console
   lk cloud auth
   lk project set-default firstaiagent
   lk agent create --region ap-south
   ```

2. Import this Git repository into Vercel, or link the project with the Vercel CLI from the repository root.
3. In Vercel **Project Settings → Environment Variables**, add `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` for Production. Use the values from your LiveKit project. Leave `LIVEKIT_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT` unset so the token dispatches to the production deployment.
4. Deploy to Production. Vercel serves the UI and the token endpoint from the same origin.

Do not add `.env.local` to Vercel or commit it. Never share LiveKit credentials or the Upstash token with testers.

## Frontends and telephony

Pair the agent with a prebuilt frontend starter, or add telephony:

| Platform | Link | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Web** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-react`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react) | Web voice AI assistant with React & Next.js |
| **iOS/macOS** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) | Native iOS, macOS, and visionOS voice AI assistant |
| **Flutter** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) | Cross-platform voice AI assistant app |
| **React Native** | [`livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native) | Native mobile app with React Native & Expo |
| **Android** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-android`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) | Native Android app with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose |
| **Web Embed** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed) | Voice AI widget for any website |
| **Telephony** | [Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/) | Add inbound or outbound calling to your agent |

For more options, see the [frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/).

## Testing and debugging

Simulations run full multi-turn conversations between a simulated user and your agent on LiveKit Cloud, then judge each transcript. The scenarios live in [`scenarios.yaml`](scenarios.yaml). Run them locally with the CLI:

```console
lk agent simulate text --scenarios scenarios.yaml
```

The `Simulations` workflow in [`.github/workflows/simulations.yml`](.github/workflows/simulations.yml) runs the same file on every merge to `main`, and on demand from the Actions tab. It doesn't run on every pull request push because each run uses real inference. See the [simulations guide](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/simulations/) for how to write scenarios and read results.

To check a change turn by turn without a live session, use the [agent debugger](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/debugger/) shown in [Run the agent](#run-the-agent).

To debug a running agent, open it in the [Agent Console](https://docs.livekit.io/testing/agent-console/). It shows events, tool calls, and model timing as you talk to the agent. To stream logs from a deployed agent, run `lk agent logs`.

## Using this template for your own project

After you create your own project from this template:

- **Commit `uv.lock`.** The template doesn't track it, but your project should, for reproducible builds. If you deploy to LiveKit Cloud, commit `livekit.toml` too.
- **Add repository secrets.** Add `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` as [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions) so the simulations can run in CI.

## Deploying to production

To deploy the agent to LiveKit Cloud or another environment with the included `Dockerfile`, see the [deployment guide](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/).

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting guide](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/self-hosting/local/). If you self-host, use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference, and remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
